NFT Design Cards

These cards were created to assist in designing new types of non-fungible tokens (NFTs), for example, to serve as incentives. Each card represents a different purpose or functionality of a token and summarizes the key standards associated with that purpose. The front side of each card explains the purpose in natural language, while the back side briefly outlines the relevant key standards.

How to contribute?

As the list of standards continues to grow, we need your help to keep the token cards up to date. If youâ€™d like to contribute, please open an issue in this repository.
